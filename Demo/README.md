Demo Project â€“ XXE and Secrets (Django Applications)

This repository contains a Django-based demo project showcasing how XML External Entity (XXE) attacks can be exploited in web applications, and how sensitive data might be exposed if not properly secured.

ðŸ”’ What is an XXE Attack?

XML External Entity (XXE) attacks exploit vulnerabilities in XML parsers that improperly process external entities. Malicious attackers can use XXE to:

1) Access local files on the server

2) Execute internal network requests (Server-Side Request Forgery - SSRF)

3) Leak sensitive information (e.g., system files or environment variables)

4) Possibly escalate to remote code execution under certain configurations

This vulnerability is common when user-supplied XML input is parsed insecurely without disabling external entity resolution.

ðŸ“¦ Project Structure

This project consists of two Django apps:

XXE/ â€“ A deliberately vulnerable TODO list app that parses XML data insecurely to demonstrate XXE attacks.

Secrets/ â€“ A protected app that stores sensitive data. It's not meant for direct access, but can be exposed via XXE exploitation.


ðŸ§° Prerequisites

Ensure the following are installed before you begin:

1) Python 3.9 or higher 

2) Django (latest stable version) â€“ Install with pip: pip install django

3) A virtual environment (optional but recommended): python -m venv venv


ðŸš€ Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project:

1) git clone https://github.com/psu-cse597-s25/heartbleed-analysis.git

2) cd to the working directory. Here it is Demo/xxeExploit

# (Optional) Create and activate virtual environment
python -m venv venv

source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate


3) python3 manage.py makemigrations

4) python3 manage.py migrate


5) python manage.py runserver

ðŸ§ª How to Trigger the XXE Vulnerability

The xxe app allows users to submit XML payloads using /save_todo/ API. By submitting specially crafted malicious XML, you can observe how improperly configured XML parsing can leak sensitive files or system data.

Sample payloads are listed here for testing.

--> Common EndPoint: http://127.0.0.1:8000/save_todo/ 

Benign Payload:

    <?xml version="1.0"?>
    <data>
        <todo>
            <title>Security Analysis Final presentation</title>
            <status>False</status>
        </todo>
    </data>

Malicious Payload:

    <?xml version="1.0"?>
    <!DOCTYPE data [


    <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "http://127.0.0.1:8000/secrets/">
    <!-- Use 127.0.0.1 instead of localhost -->
    ]>
    <data>&xxe;</data>
